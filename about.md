Hi, my name is **Gregory Jones**, and I just recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Saint Joseph's University. Looking forward, I plan to join the industry as a **Mobile/Web** engineer.

**Programming Skills**: Java, Swift, Objective-C, and SQL.  
**Development**:  Web & Mobile Applications (iOS/Android)

--------------------------------------------------



I'm interested in back-end software development for mobile and web platforms. I pride myself on my ability to quickly learn the languages, tools, and frameworks best for solving a problem. I have been working on [MySQL](http://www.mysqltutorial.org),[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [SQL server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016), and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) related projects.


I'm excited about developing elegant code and working on products that simplify the lives of others.

**Projects:**

* [*Hawk Ride*](https://github.com/kevinxh/SFU-Commute) student escort ride sharing services for campuses (iOS Mobile App)
* [*E-commerce Website*](https://github.com/kevinxh/eTourney) A e-commerce website that sells men and women's t-shirts (DBMS group project)
* [*Allergy Analyzer*](https://github.com/kevinxh/SFU-Commute) this aims to help users make more informed choices about food that may trigger an allergic reaction. (Android Mobile App)
