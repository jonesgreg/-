summary:    Re-designing Front-End Service Portal
categories: web dev
---

Summer ’18 - I interned at **Under Armour Global Headquarters** working with the IT Service Management team. I was tasked with re-designing the interface to be more **engaging, efficient, and global** to use. To accurately identify users needs. I conducted focus groups that would allow end-users to give us feedback about their experience with **Armour Desk**.

This project was my first experience working in Sketch and working through the UI development cycle, which included **conducting background research, online surveys, competitive analysis, focus groups, visual mockups, and interactive prototypes**.

&nbsp;<center><strong>What is Armour Desk?</strong></center>
Armour Desk is Under Armour's web application that allows employees to access an online help desk. This application will enable users to **log incidents, request hardware/software, submit change requests, onboard new employees, and more**.

&nbsp;<center><strong>Problem</strong></center>
The Problem with the current model of Armour Desk is its **lack of functionality and outdated interface**. My goal was to pinpoint the problems and work on resolving the issues to help develop a new model of Armour Desk.  The beginning of my summer at Under Armour, I did background research understanding the back end portal of Armour Desk, which is called ServiceNow. I was trained to know how the end user is enabled to **submit an incident, request hardware/software, onboard employees, and provisioning consultants**.


&nbsp;<center><strong>UX Design - Phase 1</strong></center>
To Start, I sent out a survey to departments across the company regarding their experience with Armour Desk. My review included many different questions about the application, but of course, the most important question is

</p>

&nbsp;<center><strong>What might improve the experience with Armour Desk</strong></center>
<center> - “More clear Navigation.”- Anonymous user</center>
<center> - “Faster responses time and email notification regarding status change for all request.” - Anonymous user</center>
<center> - “A better selection of services, a more intuitive interface, a service catalog that fully describes the services offered, an entirely new on-boarding form and experience for hiring managers.” - Anonymous user</center>

</p>

&nbsp;<center><strong>UX Design - Phase 2</strong></center>
The next step I sat down with the end-users and listened to what they have to say about the current model of Armour Desk.

</p>

I indented several problems with Armour Desk: unresponsive site, lack of intuitive and helpful navigation system, and the layout are very unorganized.

After conducting my background research and focus group, I identified a single overarching objective for this project: a simple minimalist design.

I learned that Under Armour is a company that strives to **“Find A Better Way”**, which mean how can better understand a system within the scope of own role and support creativity & innovation in others by listening to Teammates’s ideas , sharing our own perspective, strengthen our capabilities, and creating consistency globally , which help the go-to-market process.

Not to mentioned - How can the new design change the game?

</p>

I saw how the design and interface of Armour Desk were causing Under Armour to lose precious time trying to figure out how to utilize employee service delivery.

### Objectives:
<center> - Redesign Armour Desk to be more Engaging, Efficient, and Global to use.</center>
<center> - Serve the needs of all users by letting them quickly find what they are seeking.</center>
<center> - Provide a pleasant and delightful experience to all users by making it easy for them to complete their task.</center>
<center> - Be strategic and agile, and focus on making our content useful, interactive, and engaging. </center>&nbsp;

One of my main objectives was to re-design the interface to be **minimalist**. I used some inspiration from the Under Armour E-commerce, and try to bring that UA to feel to the Armour Desk platform. Knowing that I was making a help desk application; I would like it to be user-friendly and straightforward.

When I think of keeping it simple and user-friendly; I believe other companies follow that mindset, for instance, like **Apple**. I love Apple their aesthetic and minimalist design, which encourage me to bring that feel to life with Armour Desk.

</p>

I decided to continue to follow Under Armour’s branding guidelines. I utilized their color scheme as some cool fonts that I like: Avenir Next.

&nbsp;<center><strong>Prototypes</strong></center>

Below are some of the prototypes I developed in **Sketch** and **Adobe XD**. Several factors had to be considered. The application has to be simple for the **end-user to use**.

<center><strong>Things I learned</strong></center>

This experience was enjoyable. I never imagine myself working in Sketch. This was my first time developing mock-ups in Sketch.  It was awesome being able to design concepts to meet the needs of my team and Under Armour.

Hosting focus groups was a different experience for me. It push me out of my comfort zone of being a moderator and guiding the discussion about the end user's experience with Armour Desk.

 I spent most of the time work with the end-users and understanding the back-end; I didn’t set time aside to develop a live interactive prototype. I think if I did, it would be beneficial as a developer to get some more coding experience under my belt.
